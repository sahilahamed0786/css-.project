    <h1 class="center">The Thirsty Crow</h1>
    <p>Once there was a crow. He was very thirsty. He flew here and there in search of water but could not found water anywhere. At last, he reached in a forest. He saw a pitcher of water in the forest.
        The crow was very happy. He reached to the pitcher but water was very low. He could not drink it. He looked here and there and saw few pebbles nearby.
        He thought of a plan. He gathered some pebbles and put one by one into the pitcher of water. The water rose up. He drank water and flew away.</p>
